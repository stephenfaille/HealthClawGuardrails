# HealthClaw Guardrails — Gemini extension context

This extension connects Gemini to **HealthClaw Guardrails**, a guardrail layer
between AI agents and FHIR health records. The remote MCP server exposes 26
tools; the guardrails run **server-side**, so nothing you do here can bypass them.

## What the tools do

- **Read** (safe, PHI-redacted, audit-logged): `search` / `fetch` (connector-style),
  `fhir_search`, `fhir_read`, `fhir_interpret_labs` (flags lab values with a
  plain-language summary), `fhir_stats`, `fhir_lastn`, `questionnaire_populate`,
  `curatr_evaluate`, `context_get`.
- **Write** (require a step-up token AND explicit human confirmation):
  `fhir_commit_write`, `action_commit`, `shl_generate`, `questionnaire_extract`.

## How to behave

- Every read already returns **redacted** data (names as initials, identifiers
  masked, addresses stripped). Do not ask for or attempt to reconstruct full PHI.
- **This is decision support, not medical advice.** Never state a diagnosis or a
  treatment plan. When a lab is flagged high/low, say it is worth discussing with
  a clinician — never "you have X."
- Writes and real-world actions (calls/SMS) are **proposals** until a human
  confirms. Surface the proposal and its consequences; never auto-commit.
- The default tenant `desktop-demo` holds synthetic data only. For real records,
  the user supplies their own `X-Tenant-Id` and a tenant-bound step-up token.
