# HealthClaw Guardrails

The security layer between AI agents and clinical data. A [healthclaw.io](https://healthclaw.io) open source project.

**v1.5.0** | 614 Python + 65 Node tests | 20 MCP tools | FHIR R4 US Core v9 + R6 v6.0.0-ballot3 | Fasten TEFCA · HealthEx · HBO · Flexpa · Epic · MEDENT | Open Wearables | Real-world actions (calls/SMS) | SMART Health Links | Claude Code plugin

> FHIR standardized how health data is structured. MCP standardized how AI connects to tools.
> Nobody standardized the guardrails in between. This project does.

## What's new in v1.4.0 — Multi-Connector Health Data Pipeline

One Telegram bot. All your health records. Every major source, automatically.

The v1.4.0 release wires **five distinct health data pipelines** into HealthClaw — each with its own auth model, transport, and data format — and exposes them as unified Telegram slash commands so you never leave the chat.

| Source | Coverage | Transport | Telegram command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Fasten TEFCA** | Nationwide — all QHINs (hospitals, EHRs, labs) via CLEAR/ID.me | Webhook push | `/connect` |
| **HealthEx** | Lab + clinical aggregator | MCP Streamable HTTP pull | `/export` |
| **Health Bank One** | Identity-verified records + insurance context | MCP Streamable HTTP pull | `/hbo-connect`, `/hbo-pull` |
| **Flexpa** | 200+ payers/insurers (CMS-9115 mandate) | SmartHealthConnect bridge | `/flexpa-connect` |
| **Health Skillz (Epic)** | Epic MyChart + major patient portals | SmartHealthConnect bridge | `/epic-connect` |
| **MEDENT** | Small-practice EHR (SMART on FHIR direct) | Direct SMART on FHIR pull | `/medent-connect`, `/medent-pull` |

**New infrastructure:**

- **`/shc/ingest` endpoint** — SmartHealthConnect bridge receives FHIR bundles from Flexpa and Health Skillz pulls, applies the full guardrail stack, fires Telegram notification
- **`/shc/medent/callback` broker** — MEDENT's OAuth validator requires a public HTTPS redirect URI; Railway acts as the callback broker so the Mac mini agent can still drive the flow
- **`scripts/medent_oauth.py`** — SMART on FHIR Patient Standalone Launch (Dynamic Client Registration + PKCE + token caching + auto-refresh)
- **`scripts/export_medent_fhir.py`** — Pulls US Core R4 resources from any MEDENT practice, redacts PHI in-process
- **Telegram**: all 6 new commands deployed to all 7 OpenClaw personas (Sally, Mary, Dom, Kristy, Joe, Ronny, Shervin)

## What's new in v1.3.0 — Wearables

Heart rate, HRV, SpO2, steps, sleep, BP, glucose, body weight — from **Garmin, Oura, Polar, Suunto, Whoop, Fitbit, Strava, Ultrahuman** — flow into HealthClaw as FHIR Observations with correct LOINC codes and device Provenance. Compiled Truth timelines now include wearable-sourced data; SmartHealthConnect's `healthy-habits` + `diet-exercise` skills read them through the same `fhir_search` they already use.

- **Open Wearables sidecar** ([the-momentum/open-wearables](https://github.com/the-momentum/open-wearables), MIT) runs under a new `wearables` docker-compose profile. It owns per-provider OAuth; we own the FHIR mapping.
- **`r6/wearables/mapper.py`** translates 13 metrics to LOINC + UCUM FHIR Observations. Unknown fields fall through with `code.text` — no data loss.
- **Daemon poller** syncs every `WEARABLES_POLL_INTERVAL` (default 900s), posts through `/Bundle/$ingest-context` with step-up + `X-Agent-Id: wearable-sync`.
- **`wearables_sync_status`** MCP tool (16 tools total) returns connection status + `_meta.ui.resourceUri` pointing at the new Connection Manager MCP App.
- **MCP App** at `/r6/fhir/mcp-apps/wearables/` — cards per provider: connect / re-auth / sync / view.

Quick start: `OPEN_WEARABLES_URL=http://open-wearables:8000 docker-compose --profile wearables up -d`.

## What's new in v1.2.0 — Compiled Truth

Every other health tool shows you data. HealthClaw shows you the **trail**.

- **`GET /<type>/<id>/$compiled-truth`** — returns current redacted resource + curation state + quality score + full Provenance timeline (newest first).
- **`fhir_compiled_truth`** MCP tool — agents call this before making resource-specific claims; responses carry `_meta.ui.resourceUri` pointing to an embeddable review surface.
- **MCP App** at `/r6/fhir/mcp-apps/compiled-truth/<type>/<id>` — focused HTML page: current data, evidence timeline, approve / re-evaluate actions. Zero install.
- **Activated schema** — `curation_state` (raw → in_review → curated) and `quality_score` (0.0–1.0) now persisted on every resource.
- **`.health-context.yaml`** — single declaration of jurisdiction, audience, regulations, defaults. Read by the guardrail stack; mirrored in SmartHealthConnect.

## What It Does

This is a **vendor-neutral guardrail proxy** that sits between any AI agent and any FHIR server. Every request passes through:

- **PHI redaction** — Names truncated to initials, identifiers masked, addresses stripped, birth dates truncated to year
- **Immutable audit trail** — Every read/write logged with tenant, agent, timestamp
- **Step-up authorization** — HMAC-SHA256 tokens required for writes
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Clinical writes blocked until a human confirms (HTTP 428)
- **Tenant isolation** — Every query scoped to tenant, cross-tenant access blocked
- **Medical disclaimers** — Injected on all clinical resource reads
- **Compiled Truth** — Current state + append-only evidence trail for every resource

## Install as a Claude Plugin

HealthClaw ships as a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Two plugins are available:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add aks129/HealthClawGuardrails

# Install the FHIR guardrail plugin (this repo)
claude plugin install healthclaw-guardrails@healthclaw-marketplace

# Install the personal-health companion plugin (SmartHealthConnect)
claude plugin install smarthealthconnect@healthclaw-marketplace
```

| Plugin | Skills | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `healthclaw-guardrails` | curatr, fasten-connect, fhir-r6-guardrails, fhir-upstream-proxy, healthex-export, phi-redaction | [aks129/HealthClawGuardrails](https://github.com/aks129/HealthClawGuardrails) |
| `smarthealthconnect` | care-completion, diet-exercise, healthy-habits, kids-health, medication-refills, research-monitor | [aks129/SmartHealthConnect](https://github.com/aks129/SmartHealthConnect) |

Each skill is auto-discoverable — Claude loads it when your prompt matches the skill's trigger phrases (e.g. "check my care gaps", "redact this bundle", "run Curatr on my conditions").

## MCP Tools (14)

Tool names use underscores (not dots) for Claude Desktop / MCP client compatibility.

**Read tools** (no step-up required):

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `context_get` | Retrieve pre-built context envelopes |
| `fhir_read` | Read a FHIR resource (redacted) |
| `fhir_search` | Search with patient, code, status, date filters |
| `fhir_validate` | Structural validation |
| `fhir_stats` | Observation statistics (count/min/max/mean) |
| `fhir_lastn` | Most recent N observations per code |
| `fhir_permission_evaluate` | R6 Permission access control evaluation |
| `fhir_subscription_topics` | List available SubscriptionTopics |
| `curatr_evaluate` | Evaluate a FHIR resource for data quality issues |

**Write tools** (require step-up token):

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `fhir_propose_write` | Validate + preview without committing |
| `fhir_commit_write` | Commit with step-up auth + human-in-the-loop |
| `curatr_apply_fix` | Apply patient-approved fixes with Provenance tracking |

**Utility tools:**

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `fhir_get_token` | Issue a 5-minute step-up token (call before any write) |
| `fhir_seed` | Seed a tenant with demo Patient + Observations + Condition |

All tools add `_mcp_summary` with reasoning, clinical context, and limitations.

## Guardrail Demo

The 6-step demo at `/r6/fhir/demo/agent-loop` shows the full guardrail sequence:

1. **PHI Redaction** — Agent reads a patient, receives redacted data
2. **$validate Gate** — Agent proposes an Observation, validated before write
3. **Permission Deny** — No Permission rule exists, access denied with reasoning
4. **Permission Permit** — Permit rule created, re-evaluation succeeds
5. **Step-up + Human-in-the-loop** — Write requires both token and human confirmation
6. **Commit + Audit** — Write succeeds, full audit trail generated

## Comparison

| Feature | This Project | AWS HealthLake MCP | Medplum MCP | Raw FHIR API |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Works with any FHIR server | Yes | HealthLake only | Medplum only | N/A |
| PHI redaction on reads | Yes | No | No | No |
| Immutable audit trail | Yes | CloudTrail (separate) | Partial | No |
| Step-up auth for writes | Yes | IAM (separate) | Medplum auth | No |
| Human-in-the-loop | Yes | No | No | No |
| Permission $evaluate (R6) | Yes | No | No | No |
| Setup time | 10 seconds | 30+ minutes | 15+ minutes | Varies |

## FHIR Version Support

| Version | Profile | Status | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R4 | US Core v9 | **Stable** | Patient, Condition, AllergyIntolerance, Immunization, MedicationRequest, Procedure, DiagnosticReport, CarePlan, CareTeam, Goal, DocumentReference, Coverage, ServiceRequest, Location, Organization, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, RelatedPerson, Specimen, FamilyMemberHistory |
| R6 | v6.0.0-ballot3 | Experimental | Permission, SubscriptionTopic, DeviceAlert, NutritionIntake, DeviceAssociation, NutritionProduct, Requirements, ActorDefinition |

Both R4 and R6 resources flow through the same guardrail stack (PHI redaction, audit, step-up auth, tenant isolation). R6 ballot resources may change before final release.

## Upstream Proxy

Connect to real FHIR servers while keeping all guardrails active:

```bash
FHIR_UPSTREAM_URL=https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4 python main.py
```

- **Reads**: Fetched from upstream, then redacted + audited + disclaimers added
- **Searches**: Forwarded with all query params, results redacted per entry
- **Writes**: Validated locally first, then forwarded with step-up auth check
- **URL rewriting**: Upstream URLs never leak to clients

Tested with: HAPI FHIR R4/R5, SMART Health IT, Epic Sandbox.

## Curatr — Patient-Owned Data Quality

Curatr is a patient-facing data quality skill that evaluates FHIR health records for
coding issues and lets the patient decide how to resolve them.

```text
1. Patient connects data → HealthClaw Guardrails deidentifies and loads it
2. OpenClaw calls curatr.evaluate → checks codes against live terminology APIs
3. Issues presented in plain language with impact and fix suggestions
4. Patient approves fixes → curatr.apply_fix updates resource + creates Provenance
5. Optional: generate a structured correction request for the source provider
```

**What Curatr checks on a Condition:**

| Check | Service | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deprecated code system | Local lookup (no network) | ICD-9-CM → critical |
| ICD-10-CM code validity | NLM Clinical Tables API | Invalid code → warning |
| SNOMED CT / LOINC validity | tx.fhir.org (HL7 public) | Unknown code → warning |
| RxNorm drug code | RXNAV API (NLM) | Missing RXCUI → warning |
| Display name accuracy | Cross-checked with canonical term | Mismatch → suggestion |
| Missing required fields | Structural | No clinicalStatus → warning |

Every fix creates a linked **Provenance** resource recording patient intent, field
changes, and agent attribution. All changes are audited in the immutable trail.

## SMART Health Links (Kill the Clipboard)

Patient-controlled encrypted record sharing via QR code, implemented on top of
**[jmandel/kill-the-clipboard-skill](https://github.com/jmandel/kill-the-clipboard-skill)**
(MIT, pinned `fa0020d`) — credit Josh Mandel. HealthClaw governs what enters the
bundle (step-up auth, profiles, guardrails, audit trail); KTC governs sharing
(zero-knowledge server-side storage, SHL STU 1 protocol, revocation, in-browser
viewer).

**What it does:** The `shl_generate` MCP tool (Write group, step-up required)
fetches the patient's guardrailed FHIR bundle, encrypts it client-side in the MCP
server (the SHL server never sees plaintext), uploads ciphertext, and returns:

- `shlink` — the `shlink:/` URI to encode in a QR (an encrypted pointer, not data)
- `viewer_link` — browser URL for clinic staff
- `manage_link` — patient-only revocation + access-log URL

**Security:** The QR encodes only the encrypted pointer. PHI never appears in the
QR image. The SHL server stores only ciphertext + `sha256(auth_token)`. Persona
hard rule: see `skills/share-health-qr/SKILL.md` — never direct-encode PHI into
QR images (incident 2026-06-12).

### Quick Start (local)

```bash
# Start the SHL storage server (profile `shl`)
docker-compose --profile shl up -d

# Tell the MCP server where the SHL server lives
# Add to services/agent-orchestrator/.env or export:
export SHL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Without `SHL_SERVER_URL`, `shl_generate` returns an explicit simulation stub
(`simulated: true`) — never a fake link.

### Railway Deploy

```bash
# 1. Add the SHL service
railway add --service shl-server

# 2. Attach a persistent volume (SQLite lives here)
railway service shl-server && railway volume add --mount-path /data

# 3. Configure the SHL server
railway variables --service shl-server \
  --set BASE_URL=<public-url-of-shl-server> \
  --set DB_PATH=/data/db.sqlite

# 4. Expose a public domain
railway domain --service shl-server

# 5. Deploy — MUST run from the shl-server directory
cd services/shl-server && railway up --service shl-server

# 6. Wire the MCP server to the SHL server
railway variables --service mcp-server \
  --set SHL_SERVER_URL=<public-url-of-shl-server>
```

> **Caveat 1 — deploy from the right directory:** The repo-root `railway.toml`
> targets the Flask Dockerfile. If you run `railway up --service shl-server`
> from the repo root, Railway uses the wrong Dockerfile and the deploy fails.
> Always `cd services/shl-server` first — that directory has its own
> `railway.toml` that points to the correct image.
>
> **Caveat 2 — watchPatterns skip:** A service that inherited `watchPatterns`
> from the root config may silently skip Dockerfile-only deploys (no source
> file changes detected). The per-service `railway.toml` in `services/shl-server/`
> overrides this after the first successful build. If deploys are skipped, force
> one with `railway up --service shl-server` from the shl-server directory.
>
> **Caveat 3 — simulation mode:** Without `SHL_SERVER_URL` on the MCP server,
> `shl_generate` returns `{ simulated: true, note: "SHL_SERVER_URL not
> configured — returned stub." }`. Personas surface this note verbatim and
> never improvise an alternative.

## Personal FHIR data store — patient import flow

This walkthrough shows how to go from a raw HealthEx export to querying your
own records through Claude Code's MCP tools.

### 1. Start the stack

```bash
uv sync
uv run python main.py                         # Flask on :5000
cd services/agent-orchestrator && npm ci && npm start  # MCP on :3001
```

### 2. Import your HealthEx / Flexpa / generic FHIR bundle

```bash
# Dry-run first to preview without writing
python scripts/import_healthex.py \
  --bundle-file ~/Downloads/my-records.json \
  --dry-run

# Real import — prints context_id on success
python scripts/import_healthex.py \
  --bundle-file ~/Downloads/my-records.json \
  --tenant-id my-patient \
  --step-up-secret "$STEP_UP_SECRET"
```

### 3. Connect Claude Code via MCP

`.mcp.json` in this repo auto-configures Claude Code when you open the project.
Update `X-Tenant-ID` to match your `--tenant-id`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "healthclaw-local": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-Tenant-ID": "my-patient" }
    }
  }
}
```

Then in Claude Code:

```text
Use fhir_search to find all my Conditions
Use context_get with context_id <ctx-id> to get my full context envelope
Use curatr_evaluate on Condition/<id> to check data quality
```

### 4. Set up Fasten Connect (optional)

```bash
# .env additions
FASTEN_PUBLIC_KEY=<key>
FASTEN_PRIVATE_KEY=<key>
FASTEN_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<secret>
FASTEN_CURATR_SCAN=true    # auto-run Curatr after each import
```

Records arrive via webhook at `/r6/fasten/webhook` and are stored under the
patient's canonical tenant ID.

### 5. Deidentify for sharing

```bash
# HIPAA Safe Harbor
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: my-patient" \
  http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir/Patient/pt-1/\$deidentify

# Patient-controlled (preserves birthDate, strips institutional identifiers)
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: my-patient" \
  "http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir/Patient/pt-1/\$deidentify?mode=patient-controlled&patient_id=my-patient"
```

### 6. Telegram bot (optional)

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token> TENANT_ID=my-patient \
FHIR_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir \
python openclaw/bot.py
```

Commands: `/health`, `/conditions`, `/labs`, `/curatr`, `/curatr fix`, `/approve`.

Or via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose --profile openclaw up -d
```

### 7. Use Medplum as the backing FHIR store (optional)

Set in `.env` (leave `FHIR_UPSTREAM_URL` empty):

```bash
MEDPLUM_BASE_URL=https://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4
MEDPLUM_CLIENT_ID=<id>
MEDPLUM_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
```

All guardrails apply to Medplum responses identically to local SQLite mode.
Access tokens are cached in Redis (key `medplum:access_token`; falls back to
in-process cache when Redis is unavailable).

---

## Known Limitations

- Local mode: JSON blob storage with table-scan search (no indexed fields)
- Structural validation only (no StructureDefinition conformance or terminology binding)
- SubscriptionTopic stored but notifications not dispatched
- Human-in-the-loop is a header flag, not cryptographic confirmation
- OAuth endpoints implemented but not enforced on routes (demonstration only)
- No historical versioning (version_id increments but old versions not retrievable)
- Upstream proxy: no response caching, no cross-version translation
