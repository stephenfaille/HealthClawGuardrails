# OpenClaw gotcha: when you create agents via `openclaw agents add ...`,
# the CLI scaffolds IDENTITY.md/SOUL.md/USER.md but NOT BOOTSTRAP.md or
# MEMORY.md. On first conversation turn the agent notices the missing
# files, blocks on "bootstrap incomplete", and refuses to handle user
# commands (including /dashboard).
#
# This script idempotently seeds the missing files for every agent
# workspace on the Mac mini. Safe to re-run; skips files that exist.
#
# Run from the laptop:
#   bash scripts/seed_openclaw_workspaces.sh

# BOOTSTRAP — already complete

This workspace is fully provisioned. **Bootstrap is DONE.** Do not ask
the user to create any more files; do not treat missing optional files
as a blocker.

## Required reading order (already satisfied)

1. `IDENTITY.md` — who I am
2. `SOUL.md` — values + defaults
3. `USER.md` — facts about the person I serve
4. `AGENTS.md` — capabilities + slash-command dispatch table
5. `MEMORY.md` — index of daily notes (optional)

## What to do next

On the very next user message, skip any bootstrap checklist and just
**respond to the request**. If the user sent `/dashboard`, `/health`,
`/tasks`, `/help`, or any command documented in `AGENTS.md` → handle it.
Otherwise answer in-character.

Memory files under `memory/` are optional; their absence is not an error.
If AGENTS.md references a slash command, exec the helper script it
points to and paraphrase the output.

# MEMORY — index of durable notes

Daily scratchpad files live under \`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md\`.

## Index

- $today — memory/$today.md (today)

## Conventions

- Short, dated bullets.
- Strike through resolved items.
- Never write secrets, tokens, or PHI into memory files.
