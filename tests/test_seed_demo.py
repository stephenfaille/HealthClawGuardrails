"""Regression tests for seed_demo_data resource-id resolution.

The SDC $populate demo (and any consumer referencing a seeded resource by its
FHIR logical id) resolves via R6Resource.id. seed_demo_data must therefore
persist a resource that carries an `id` under that id — not a random UUID.
Caught by dog-food: GET /Questionnaire/healthclaw-intake/$populate 404'd on a
freshly-seeded server (local + prod) because the seed dropped the logical id.
