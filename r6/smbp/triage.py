"""SMBP triage — the single source of truth for the §2.2 decision logic.

Pure functions. The hypertension-coordinator skill, the Demo 2 voice script,
and the clinician report flags all classify through here so they cannot drift.

Administrative logic only: this classifies a reading into an action band; it
never produces clinical advice text.

Emergency-cutout interpretation (deliberate): a screened symptom escalates to
the emergency pathway only when the reading is also severe (>=180/120). A symptom
at a non-severe reading is NOT auto-classified as emergency. This follows the
spec's §2.2 band table; the spec's prose phrasing ("...OR any symptom") is
reconciled to the table here. Pending clinical sign-off.
